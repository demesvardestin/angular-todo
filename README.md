## About

This is a todo app implementation in HTML, CSS and some Angular. It's intended
to run as an SPA, though the layout may not fully reflect that. My goal while
making it was to demonstrate my understanding of key frontend design patterns.
The app uses the following tools and frameworks:

- Bootstrap
- Angular
- HTML5
- Web Storage
